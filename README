# 0 - Prerequisites

Since this is a Tcl library, you need to have a Tcl installation on 
your system to use it. On most Unix systems this is automatically the 
case. There's also nothing that prevents you from installing your own
private Tcl-version in case the system-wide installation doesn't fulfill
all requirements.

The easiest way to obtain a working Tcl interpreter is to download the
appropriate tclkit binary from 

   http://www.equi4.com/tclkit.html

To compile the Steenrod package you also need to know the location of the tcl
header file "tcl.h" and the stubs library "libtclstub". Standard places to
look are /usr/include and /usr/lib. If you don't have these files you can
either 

 - download the ActiveTcl distribution from http://www.activestate.com/   
   (recommended, also has lots of useful extra packages)

 - build your own tcl from the Tcl sources: http://tcl.sourceforge.net/

# 1 - Compiling the Steenrod library

1) Change to the directory "src". 

2) Adapt the following variables in the "Makefile"

SYSTEM        either "Unix" or "Windows"
TCLINCDIR     point to directory that contains "tcl.h"
TCLLIBDIR     point to directory that contains "libtclstub"
TCLSTUBLIB    name of the "tclstub" library

3) Type "make install"

This should produce a file "libsteenrod.so" in the directory 

   ./lib/<platform name>

4) Test the integrity of the package.

Change to the directory "test" and run the file "all.tcl". 

Example:
cn@jehova:~/steenrod/test> tclsh all.tcl
Tests running in interp:  /usr/bin/tclsh
Tests located in:  /home/cn/steenrod/test
Tests running in:  /home/cn/steenrod/test
Temporary files stored in /home/cn/steenrod/test
Test files run in separate interpreters
Running tests that match:  *
Skipping test files that match:  l.*.test
Only running test files that match:  *.test
Tests began at Do Mai 05 20:44:20 CEST 2005
enum.test
linalg.test
matenc.test
monomap.test
poly.test
prime.test

Tests ended at Do Mai 05 20:44:40 CEST 2005
all.tcl:        Total   5997    Passed  5621    Skipped 376     Failed  0
Sourced 6 Test Files.
Number of tests skipped for each constraint:
        376     BIGTEST

The important line here is the one that says "Failed 0". This means that
presumably everything is ok.

5) Create the documentation. 

This needs the "doctools" Tcl package (included in the ActiveTcl distribution).
First change to the directory "doc". Adapt the path at the beginning of
makedocs.tcl so that the doctools package can be found. Then just type "make".

The documentation is produced in various formats: html, tmml, man. Only the
man pages look nice. If you add the doc/man directory to your MANPATH
environment variable you can then access the documentation through the man
program. The Steenrod documentation can be found in section "3st".

Example:

   man -S 3st steenrod

6) Run the demo resolver

Change to directory demo. Then try, for example,

  wish ./resolver.tcl -prime 3 -algebra '0 -1 {9 9 9 9 9 9} 0' -maxdim 80 -maxs 25

Instead of "wish" you could also take "tclkit"; just plain "tclsh" will not
work because that doesn't contain the graphical Tk library.

The algebra format might deserve some explanation: the algebra is specified as
an "extended monomial" (see "mono" manpage). The meaning of the 4 constituents
is this:

    "0"          coefficient (ignored)
    "-1"         bitmask, specifying the Bocksteins (all in this case)
    "9 9 9 9 9"  profile of the reduced part of the subalgebra     
    "0"          generator id (ignored)

If you wonder where the resolutions are stored, rest assured: they
aren't. When you exit the program, all of the information is lost...

There is also a non-graphical version that runs when you specify "-usegui 0".

7) Enjoy!

Should 7) for some reason not be possible, complain to nassau@nullhomotopie.de

Good luck!
